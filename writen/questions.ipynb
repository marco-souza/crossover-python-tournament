    "We have prepared a project assessment. Please download the project from this link. Review the Readme file with instructions on how to proceed. You can use an IDE of your choice. Once completed, please zip the project and store it in a shared location where the Crossover team can access and download the project for evaluation. Please add your link to the shared file in the text box below.\n",

    "There are massive requests for historical charts, because each time we aggregate data from hourly records to generate daily data, this operation overloads the server, Please describe how to optimize this operation without adding new servers. The description should cover all details in application layers or database -if required- and any edge case.\n",

    "It´s possible to identify and pre-cache some common aggregations, to avoid a re-works for the server every time. The result for commons aggregations could be saved in an in-memory database, like Redis, and, before recalculating an aggregation, we could check if it's was calculated before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other option would be to index our historical data in a Search Engine, like Elasticsearch, and delegate the optimization details to this search engine and just care about integrations with others tools and systems. It's probably faster and more secure than build our own search engine.\n",
